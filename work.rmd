From the table we can see that Physical and Mental health have a higher percentage of zeros. This means that just over 70% of the people in our data set are not physically active while about 60% of the respondents do not report having mental health issues. 

We can also see that there are no N/A values in our data set. This is not surprising because our source data was cleaned before.

# Finding the mean of numerical variables grouped by heart disease
plot_num(heart)

heart %>%
  group_by(HD) %>%
  summarise_at(vars("GeneralHealth", 
                    "PhysicalActivity", 
                    "Ethnicity"), mean)
```

```{r}
loadPkg("corrplot")
cor(heart$HD,heart$GeneralHealth)

```

```{r}
hist(heart$GeneralHealth)
hist(heart$Ethnicity)
```

```{r}

contable = table(heart$GeneralHealth, heart$HD)
xkabledply(contable, title="Contingency Table for Heart Disease and GeneralHealth")
addmargins(contable)

prop <-prop.table(contable)
percent <- round(prop*100, 2)

print ("Contingency Table for heart Disease and General Health in Percentage")
print (percent)
barplot(with(heart, table(GeneralHealth, HD)), main="heart Disease & GeneralHealth", beside=T, col=3:2)
```

```{r, results = 'markup'}
# Subset Male & Female with and without Heart Disease
female <- subset(heart, Sex== "Female")
male  <- subset (heart, Sex == "Male")
```




```{r, results = 'markup'}
# Subsetting genders based on respondents that have heart disease 
female_HD<- subset(female, HD==1)
male_HD<- subset(male, HD== 1)
```

```{r}
#T-test
t.test(female_HD$GeneralHealth, male_HD$GeneralHealth)
```

The p-value is less than the 8% significance level, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the overall average GeneralHealth is different between the male and female populations. From the mean values, we see that men have a mean GeneralHealth of 3.12 while women have a GeneralHealth of 3.19. A difference of 0.17. 

```{r}
t.test(female_HD$PhysicalActivity, male_HD$PhysicalActivity)
```

```{r}
boxplot(HD~GeneralHealth,data=heart)
```

```{r}
plot(HD~PhysicalActivity,data=heart)
```

```{r}
plot(HD~Ethnicity,data=heart)
```

```{r}
plot(HD~DiffWalking,data=heart)
```
 

```{r}

t.test(heart$GeneralHealth, heart$HD)
t.test(heart$PhysicalActivity, heart$HD)
t.test(heart$Ethnicity, heart$HD)
```

```{r}
Genh_HD=table(heart$GeneralHealth,heart$HD)
chi_1=chisq.test(Genh_HD)
chi_1
HD_Eth=table(heart$PhysicalActivity,heart$HD)
chi_2=chisq.test(HD_Eth)
chi_2
```
For all the chi^2 tests we performed above, the p-value<0.05. So all the above rejects null hypothesis. 
Every GeneralHealth,PhysicalActivity has a relationship with heart Disease. 

```{r, results = 'markup'}
Regression <- lm(HD~GeneralHealth, data=heart)
BIC(Regression)
summary (Regression)
```
```{r}
Regression2 <- lm(HD~GeneralHealth+Ethnicity, data=heart)
BIC(Regression2)
summary (Regression2)
```

```{r}
reg_3 <- lm(HD~GeneralHealth+PhysicalActivity+Ethnicity, data=heart)
BIC(reg_3)
summary (reg_3)
```

With each new addition of a variable, we see that the adjusted R-squared is increasing indicating that the model fit is improving. However, the fit statistic is still quite low.Since model 3 has the highest adjusted r-squared and the lowest BIC values, it will be our preferred model. 

```{r}
newdata1<- subset(heart, HD==1)
newdata1_1<-head(newdata1,27373)
nrow(newdata1_1)
newdata0<- subset(heart, HD==0)
