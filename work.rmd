From the table we can see that Physical and Mental health have a higher percentage of zeros. This means that just over 70% of the people in our data set are not physically active while about 60% of the respondents do not report having mental health issues. 

We can also see that there are no N/A values in our data set. This is not surprising because our source data was cleaned before.

#5-Very good,4-poor,3-Good,2-fair,1-excellent

There is very less differnce in General Health, Even people are healthy (normal GeneralHealth) people have No heartDisease by 3.22 times than people wih people with non general health get by 3.12

barplot(with(heart, 
             table(Ethnicity, HD)), 
        main="heart Disease & GeneralHealth", 
        beside=T,col = 3:5 )
```


```{r}
boxplot(heart$Gener)
```
```{r, results = 'markup'}
# Subsetting genders based on respondents that have heart disease 
female_HD<- subset(female, HD==1)
male_HD<- subset(male, HD== 1)
```

```{r}
#T-test
t.test(female_HD$GeneralHealth, male_HD$GeneralHealth)
t.test(female_HD$PhysicalActivity, male_HD$PhysicalActivity)                  
```


```{r}
boxplot(HD~GeneralHealth,data=heart)
```

```{r}
plot(HD~PhysicalActivity,data=heart)
```

```{r}

```{r}

```{r, results = 'markup'}
# Subset Male & Female with and without Heart Disease
female <- subset(heart, Sex== "Female")
male  <- subset (heart, Sex == "Male")

# T-test of BMI between Genders 
t.test(female$GeneralHealth, male$GeneralHealth)
```
The p-value is less than the 5% significance level, allowing us to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the overall average GeneralHealth is different between the male and female populations. From the mean values, we see that men have a mean GeneralHealth of 3.20 while women have a GeneralHealth of 3.23 A difference of 0.03.
```{r, results = 'markup'}
# Subsetting genders based on respondents that have heart disease 
female_HD<- subset(female, HD==1)
male_HD<- subset(male, HD== 1)
```

```{r}
#T-test
t.test(female_HD$GeneralHealth, male_HD$GeneralHealth)
                  
```
From the T-test output above, we see that the p-value is 0.60, which is greater than 0.05. This means that we fail to reject the null and conclude that there is no significant difference in the average BMI between men and women who do have heart disease. 

```{r}

t.test(heart$GeneralHealth, heart$HD)
t.test(heart$PhysicalActivity, heart$HD)
```

```{r}
Genh_HD=table(heart$GeneralHealth,heart$HD)
chi_1=chisq.test(Genh_HD)
chi_1
HD_Eth=table(heart$PhysicalActivity,heart$HD)
chi_2=chisq.test(HD_Eth)
chi_2
```
For all the chi^2 tests we performed above, the p-value<0.05. So all the above rejects null hypothesis. 
Every GeneralHealth,PhysicalActivity has a relationship with heart Disease.
